# Lyft Test
Here is the 2nd assignment! This app was made using React.js, axios, and styled components for the Frontend. A POST request is made to the backend server using Node.js.

Here is the deployed frontend: https://lyfttest.vercel.app/

Here is the deployed backend: https://lyftbackend.herokuapp.com/

Below is a screen shot of my solution:
